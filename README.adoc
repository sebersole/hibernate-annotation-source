== Boot models

Reworking of how Hibernate processes "managed resources" (classes,XML) and builds its
`org.hibernate.mapping` metamodel.

See https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/discussions/5998

The goals:

- Move away from reflection - this allows better support for runtime enhancement
- Facilitate the ability to move away from HCANN (to Jandex)
- More uniform handling of XML
- Use of better defined stages to reduce the need for so many `SecondPass` registrations
